## Other Enhancements
I added simpler icons for the themeToggler, and made the navigation bar fixed, making it easier to use.
I also chose different font weights for paragraphs to form a better visual text hierarchy and adjusted the padding so that the text lines up on the pages.
I used eleventy's pagination to generate pages from a json file for each service that is shown in the services carousel on the home page.
I also use netlify's image CDN to get images that I can specify size and quality for.
