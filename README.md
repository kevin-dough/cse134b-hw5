## Other Enhancements
I added simpler icons for the themeToggler, made the navigation bar fixed, changed the hidden hamburger navigation links to a horizontal format.
The new nav bar makes it easier to use.
I also chose different font weights for paragraphs to form a better visual text hierarchy and adjusted the padding so that the text lines up on the pages.
